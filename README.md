# CoffeeScriptToo
My own fork of CoffeeScript - with some bells and whistles

<pre>
+ Literals with underscores: 0xFFFF_FFFF -- done;
- Pi, date/time literals etc - maybe;
- [1..N] translate to i=1;i&lt;N;++i, also cases for [...N], [N...], [N...0], [a..b by -1], [a..b by k];
- foo'abc' should be parsed! good for J, must be good here too;
- // and %% as floor and frac (= x//1 and x%%1); |x as abs, etc etc :)
- "abc"*5 and [1,2,3]$10... others from J? we'll see;
- [5 6 7 8] or even 5 6 7 8... [[1 0 0][0 1 0][0 0 1]];
- ...more to follow.
